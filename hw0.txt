# Description of your program (part 7)
1. Locate the document

6. Use a counter to count the number of words in the document, as identified by spaces
7. For each word identified, increase the counter by one
8. Retrieve the next line in the document and repeat step 7
9. Once there are no more lines remaining in the document, return the value of the counter as the result

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
It wasn’t necessarily difficult compared to say, something like math, but it was draining. In fact, there
are still lots of possibilities to account for that I did not tackle. For instance, different languages,
different separators, typos, etc. It was unsatisfying to describe the instructions in English, as it
felt like there was a lot of work being put into describing a seemingly straightforward task.

What I’d like to get out of the course is to sharpen my programming skills to the point that I’m
comfortable with making scripts and creating programs that utilize various APIs. JSON and XML
processing would also be helpful. I don’t expect to go into a programming-intensive career in
the future, but I do think having a moderate amount of technical knowledge and good scripting
capabilities will help out a lot down the road.
